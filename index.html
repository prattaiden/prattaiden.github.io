        <p id = "paragraphMe">I am currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Software Development at The University of Utah, seeking to leverage this expertise alongside my solid foundation in Biology and prior research-based roles. My background includes dedicated work in molecular biology laboratories, focusing on process improvement and pioneering research.

            Embarking on this new venture in software development, I approach it with enthusiasm and a dedicated commitment to achieving new goals. Proficient in a range of coding languages such as C++, C, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and Android Studio, I continuously thrive on learning, recognizing the perpetual opportunities for self-improvement and skill enhancement.

            Beyond coding, I am passionate about swimming, biking, running, and engaging in high-level competition across various races.</p>
